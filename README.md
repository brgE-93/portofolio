##  About
Hi my name is Emna ,and welcome to my mini website !

I am pursuing a Master's Degree in Data Science at the respected CNAM, where I‚Äôm receiving solid training in all the major fields of Data Science,  like Statistical Analysis, machine learning ,data analysisI .I also have a software development background from my education at Sorbonne University . I am passionate about AI in  general and its real-world applications .
 I'm excited by learning new things,  and spreading the word of data!
Lets see some of my projects in the section below ,I'll link my work to their GitHub repositories, so feel free to download and experiment with my code.

##  Projects

### **Sentiment analysis on products reviews with lexicon model and DistillBERT transformers**

[![View on GitHub](https://img.shields.io/badge/GitHub-View_on_GitHub-blue?logo=GitHub)](https://github.com/brgE-93/DistilBert_review)

- Conducted a sentiment analysis for Amazon products reviews (from very bad to very good) as part of a personnal project not included in any academic work.
- I tried different approaches: - a lexicon model Vader to analyze the polarity of each review and conclude about the global sentiment ditribution .
                                - a pre trained transformer from Hugging Face Distilbert to perform a multilabel classification and save it for futur prediction if necessary.
- Language: Python
- Tools:Google Collab, PyTorch, Transformers, DistillBert,Vader model, NLTK, Scikit-Learn, NumPy, Pandas, Plotly, Matplotlib, Seaborn,Pickle.
- Challenges: - Dealing with a significant  amount of data
              - consuming a lot of computational ressources
              - time consuming

### **Sales insights dashboard using with Power BI**

[![View on GitHub](https://img.shields.io/badge/GitHub-View_on_GitHub-blue?logo=GitHub)](https://github.com/brgE-93/Sales_Insights_Dashboard)

-In this Power BI personal project , I will use a real-world dataset from a company .
We immerse ourselves in a hypothetical scenario to gain insights into missed opportunities and sales from 2017 to 2020. I will utilize Power BI tools and incorporate DAX expressions to construct insightful visualizations of my findings.

- Language: Dax
- Tools:Power BI, MySQl,DAX

### **Statistical study about of medical data**

[![View on GitHub](https://img.shields.io/badge/GitHub-View_on_GitHub-blue?logo=GitHub)](https://github.com/brgE-93/MLproject)

- This statistical study focuses on a medical database extracted from the BRFSS. I aim to characterize profiles of individuals affected by cardiovascular diseases based on various risk factors, including medical history, lifestyle, as well as physical and mental conditions. We seek to identify possible similarities or disparities among these patients.
I  conducted univariate and bivariate statistical analysis. Subsequently, I will perform a Multiple Correspondence Analysis (MCA) followed by an unsupervised classification method ,a typologie (CAH)
- Language: R
- Tools: GNU R,FactomineR,Factoshiny
- Challenges:   choice of statistical tests

### **machine learning for disease prediction**

[![View on GitHub](https://img.shields.io/badge/GitHub-View_on_GitHub-blue?logo=GitHub)](https://github.com/brgE-93/Analysededonnees)

- For this project I have to solve a binary classification problem, predict if an individual is subject to heart disease according to several criteria collected by
professionals in the field.  Conducted data cleansing on raw data.
I trained and optimized several predictive models with pipelines (Decision Trees, RandomForest, Boosting, SVM, logistic regression).
Selection of the best model to deploy in heroku for futur prediction
- Language:python
- Tools:Jupiter Notebook ,VScode,Heroku,Flask,scikit-learn,pandas,seaborn,numpy,matplotlib,gunicorn,flask,Postman
- Challenges:   - imbalanced dataset

**Design and implementation of an interactive 3D environment**

[![View on GitHub](https://img.shields.io/badge/GitHub-View_on_GitHub-blue?logo=GitHub)](https://github.com/brgE-93/Environnementinteractif)

- For this project I had to Design and implement a interactive 3D environment using game engine Unity.I was in a  team of 3 people.
  Defining gameplay from A to Z for a game involves creating interactions with the user interface, interactions within the game environment (whether with non-player characters (NPCs) or the scenery), as well as developing behaviors based on artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms
- Language:C#
- Tools:Unity,unity asset store,mixamo, mono develop,Trello
- Challenges:   - Find an interesting story for the game
