## :rocket: Projects

**Sentiment analysis on products reviews with lexicon model and DistillBERT transformers**
- Conducted a sentiment analysis for Amazon products reviews (from very bad to very good) as part of a personnal project not included in any academic work.
- I tried different approaches: - a lexicon model Vader to analyze the polarity of each review and conclude about the global sentiment ditribution .
                                - a pre trained transformer from Hugging Face Distilbert to perform a multilabel classification and save it for futur prediction if necessary.
- Language: Python
- Tools:Google Collab, PyTorch, Transformers, DistillBert,Vader model, NLTK, Scikit-Learn, NumPy, Pandas, Plotly, Matplotlib, Seaborn,Pickle.
- Challenges: - Dealing with a significant  amount of data
              - consuming a lot of computational ressources
              - time consuming
  
**Sales insights dashboard using with Power BI**
-In this Power BI personal project , I will use a real-world dataset from a company .
We immerse ourselves in a hypothetical scenario to gain insights into missed opportunities and sales from 2017 to 2020. I will utilize Power BI tools and incorporate DAX expressions to construct insightful visualizations of my findings.

- Language: Dax
- Tools:Power BI, MySQl,DAX

**Statistical study about of medical data**
- This statistical study focuses on a medical database extracted from the BRFSS. I aim to characterize profiles of individuals affected by cardiovascular diseases based on various risk factors, including medical history, lifestyle, as well as physical and mental conditions. We seek to identify possible similarities or disparities among these patients.
I will conduct univariate and bivariate statistical analysis. Subsequently, I will perform a Multiple Correspondence Analysis (MCA) followed by an unsupervised classification method ,a typologie (CAH)
- Language: R
- Tools: GNU R,FactomineR,Factoshiny
- Challenges:   choice of statistical tests
  
**machine learning for disease prediction**
- For this project I have to solve a binary classification problem, predict if an individual is subject to heart disease according to several criteria collected by
professionals in the field. I trained and optimized several predictive models with pipelines (Decision Trees, RandomForest, Boosting, SVM, logistic regression).
Selection of the best model to deploy in heroku for futur prediction
- Language:python
- Tools:Jupiter Notebook ,VScode,Heroku,Flask,scikit-learn,pandas,seaborn,numpy,matplotlib,gunicorn,flask,Postman
- Challenges:   - imbalanced dataset
